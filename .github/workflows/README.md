# Build and Push Docker Image Github Action

This Github Action builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile and pushes it to Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, and Jfrog Container Registry.

## Usage

1. Create a `.github/workflows/docker.yml` file in your Github repository.
1. Copy the contents of this action into the `docker.yml` file.
1. If using artifactory, login to your instance and
    1. Create a `Local Repository` that will serve as our Container Registry.
    1. Select `Docker` as the package type.
    1. Set a value for `Repository Key`. This will be your repository name (`JFROG_REPOSITORY` as we'll see in the steps below).
    1. Select your repository from the `Artifactory > Artifacts` view.
    1. Click `Set Me Up` and `Generate token and create instructions`.
    1. Save the generated token, this will be your registry password (`JFROG_TOKEN` as we'll see in the steps below).
    1. Your Jfrog email will be your username (`JFROG_USERNAME` as we'll see in the steps below).
    1. Your Jfrog fully qualified domain name (e.g; `artifactory.yourcompany.io`) will be your registry name (`JFROG_REGISTRY` as we'll see in the steps below).
1. Create secrets for your Docker Hub username and token, your GitHub token, and your Jfrog username, token, registry, and repository. Add these secrets to your repository's secrets.
 
```yaml
secrets:
  DOCKERHUB_USERNAME: <your_username>
  DOCKERHUB_TOKEN: <your_token>
  GH_TOKEN: <your_token>
  JFROG_USERNAME: <your_username>
  JFROG_TOKEN: <your_token>
  JFROG_REGISTRY: <your_registry>
  JFROG_REPOSITORY: <your_repository>
```
4. Modify the tags field in the Build and push step to reflect your desired Docker image name and version.
```yaml
- name: Build and push
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
  with:
    context: .
    file: ./docker/Dockerfile
    push: true
    tags: |
      ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/sammwise:latest
      ghcr.io/${{ github.repository_owner }}/sammwise:latest
      ${{ secrets.JFROG_REGISTRY }}/${{ secrets.JFROG_REPOSITORY }}/sammwise:latest
```
## Workflow
1. The workflow is triggered when code is pushed to the main branch, or when it is manually triggered from the Actions tab.
1. The build job is started on an ubuntu-latest runner.
1. The Docker image is built from the Dockerfile located in the ./docker directory.
1. The image is tagged with the specified tags.
1. The Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry.
